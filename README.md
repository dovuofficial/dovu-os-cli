# DOVU OS Engine Node Tooling

General tooling for the consumption of DOVU OS engine, this is used internally as well as helper scripts for those getting started with the platform.

The aim is to provide a one-for-one parity against the API, while saving time on state and data management compared to just using Postman.

The issue with the former is that it can be a challenge to test and script against software like postman, there will always be times you'll need to manually update vars.

A mini-framework that provide a list of common actions to consume workflows and in parallel store the ongoing changes of state of the related actors and instances to be shared internally.
